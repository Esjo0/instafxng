<p>Dear [NAME],</p>
<p>The main purpose of forex trading is to make more money.</p>
<p>You probably wonder sometimes, how does this training translates to money for me?</p>
<p>It really does and I'll explain that to you shortly.</p>
<p>Tare has heard a lot about Forex trading, how many Nigerians are earning in foreign currencies by trading Forex.</p>
<p>As soon as he gets the opportunity to trade Forex, he jumped on it! He was thrilled and went ahead to open an account and trade.</p>
<p>He couldn't wait, he just wanted to get to it immediately so he funded his account and after placing a few trades, he lost all his initial capital.</p>
<p>What happened to Tare? He thought Forex was a get rich quick scheme and he didn't take his time to learn how to trade before he started trading.</p>
<p>The truth: Forex trading is no joke so it's important that you gain adequate knowledge of how to trade in the Forex market with lots of profits.</p>
<p>Like every business, it's important to learn the ropes of Forex trading before starting or committing your funds to it and this is what this training offers.</p>
<p>Many of the clients who started the training have gone ahead and are already making money from Forex trading.</p>
<p>Don't put money on the table [NAME], <a href="http://bit.ly/2iExTpN" title="Click to continue your training">click here</a> to continue now.</p>

<p>Carrie Wilkerson once said, 'The longer you're not taking action, the more money you're losing.'</p>
<p>Is this true [NAME]?</p>
<p>Everyone has a dream to live full and free; live in the best of houses, travel around the world, have enough time to spend with the people they love, the list goes on...</p>
<p>Let's face it, will everyone be rich and achieve this goals?</p>
<p>Not at all and the reason is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>The measure of your success will be to the degree which you will stretch yourself.</p>
<p>It's true [NAME], If you give 50% attention and time to things you do, you won't get 200% result from it.</p>
<p>When the input is little, the output will equally be small. This is one rule of thumb that holds true for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want the best things of life and you really want to live your dreams, you need to give things your 100% so you can get great results.</p>
<p>Don't miss this chance to make more money from a side business that is hassle free.</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>How are you doing today?</p>
<p>It's been a while since you last checked into your training portal.</p>
<p>I guess you have been very busy.</p>
<p>Don't I understand? I really do.</p>
<p>There are only 24 hours in a day and it's not enough to do all that we have to do within the day.</p>
<p>A quote from an unknown author says... â€˜Many things aren't equal but everyone gets the same 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We make time for what we truly want.'</p>
<p>[NAME], how about creating time to go through the training so you can start generating income from Forex trading right after the training.</p>
<p>With the current Nigeria economy, it's has become increasingly difficult to thrive on just one source of income.</p>
<p>Ready to fire that dream of having more than enough money again? Let's help you achieve your goal!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2iExTpN" title="Click to continue your training">Click here to go to class right away</a>.</p>
