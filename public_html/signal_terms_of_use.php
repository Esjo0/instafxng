                                <p>Remember Online Forex Trading is a highly leveraged service and carries a degree of risk so do not use borrowed capital or money you cannot afford to lose to trade Forex. Always make sure you apply sound money management as high lot-size (volume) can be unforgiving. Never enter a trade with more than 10% of your account size as careless trading can result in the loss of your entire capital. Also, trading the Forex Markets may not be suitable for you.</p>
