                                <p>What is thrilling is how much you can get without doing anything extra other
                                    than just trading as usual. You do not enter for a draw or trade a particular
                                    lot size to qualify "Just Trade!"</p>

                                <h4>What is it?</h4>
                                <p>Our new unified reward program which rewards every single one of our loyal clients daily, monthly and annually.</p>
                                <p>Several tens of thousands of dollars will be paid out to clients in rewards and redemptions during the one year duration of each round of the promo.</p>
                                <p>The exciting thing is that everyone is a winner. Every client gets a piece of the pie as long as you deposit funds to your account or you complete trades on any of your accounts held with us.</p>

                                <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                                <p>Each time you make a deposit to your account or trade as usual you earn some pointâ€™s equivalent to your deposit or trading actions. Our proprietary reward technology automatically calculates the points you have earned and your reward account is updated accordingly.</p>

                                <h4>When can I redeem points?</h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You can only redeem your points to credit your instaforex account from 100 points and above.</li>
                                    <li>If you have a minimum of 100 points you will be presented with the option of redeeming some of
                                        your points for InstaForex credit to your account. For example if you are initiating a deposit
                                        transaction of $100 to your InstaForex account and you have 1000 reward points, you will be able
                                        to redeem up to 1000 points for another $100 hence your InstaForex account will be credited with
                                        a total of $200. Every client is eligible for this as long as you have earned the minimum 100
                                        reward points.</li>
                                    <li>Points can only be redeemed when depositing funds.</li>
                                </ol>
