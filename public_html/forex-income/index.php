                        <p>I can never forget year 2016 as it brought about an abrupt change for me financially.</p>
                        <p>My woes started with fuel scarcity as we entered into year 2016 and it became
                            uncontrollable when tomatoes started turning to Gold.</p>
                        <p>I was confused, shocked and fed up. First in January the fuel scarcity, next the
                            Naira fell against the dollar, the things I could afford without thinking twice
                            became a board meeting with my wife for approval.</p>
                        <p>The cost of living skyrocketed as a result of the increment in the prices of food stuffs
                            but my salary was still the same.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="images/free-training-banner-2.jpg" alt="" class="center-block img-responsive"></p>
                        <p>
                            What do I do now? It was scary and confusing. My kids had to resume school 
                            (By the way, school fees had increased), fuel price had doubled again and 
                            I was still in the same old job, getting paid the same old salary and I still 
                            had to drive through the Lagos traffic to get to work. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My only choice was to find how I could make money online, as I went on with my 
                            day to day activities.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="images/free-training-banner-3.jpg" alt="" class="center-block img-responsive"></p>
                        <p>I first heard of buying and selling of currencies (Forex) 
                            in 2007, how it was profitable and you could make oil money by trading. On the 
                            other hand, I heard it was too volatile a business and the risk involved was great. 
                            "Which business has no risk?" While I made inquiries on trading Forex, I learnt why 
                            people fail in Forex.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People run into forex thinking it is a get rich quick scheme</li>
                            <li>People start trading without adequate training (Information)</li>
                            <li>People gamble</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I started to trade FOREX in the month of March and it has been the 
                            best channel for an extra income because while sleeping or working, 
                            I still get to make money. Even if the naira crashes against the 
                            dollar or not, my cash flows in steadily. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today the story has changed, I am not the man I used to be since I 
                            started trading Forex, yes, things are still expensive, yes, fuel 
                            price is still high, my childrenâ€™s school fees is still on the 
                            increase but I am able to win over the situation since I now make 
                            more money trading Forex.
